Add collection-parent index for Collection Group queries.\n * 9.  Change RemoteDocumentChanges store to be keyed by readTime rather than\n *     an auto-incrementing ID. This is required for Index-Free queries.\n * 10. Rewrite the canonical IDs to the explicit Protobuf-based format.\n * 11.

This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and\n * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\n *\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\n * will designate one client as the “primary client”. An effort is made to pick\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\n * IndexedDb’s “owner” store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\n * primary.\n *\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\n * persistence.\n *\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\n *\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\n * operations will automatically fail.\n *\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\n *\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\n * longer optional.\n */\n/**\n * Helper to get a typed SimpleDbStore for the primary client object store.\n */\nfunction Xi(t) {\n    return $r(t, Vr.store);\n}\n\n/**\n * Helper to get a typed SimpleDbStore for the client metadata object store.\n */ function $i(t) {\n    return $r(t, Jr.store);\n}\n\n/**\n * Generates a string used as a prefix when storing data in IndexedDB and\n * LocalStorage.\n */ function Zi(t, e) {\n    // Use two different prefix formats:\n    //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID . databaseID / ...\n    //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID / ...\n    // projectIDs are DNS-compatible names and cannot contain dots\n    // so there's no danger of collisions.\n    var n = t.projectId;\n    return t.m || (n += \".\" + t.database), \"firestore/\" + e + \"/\" + n + \"/\"\n    /**\n * @license\n * Copyright 2020 Google LLC\n *\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n *\n *   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n * limitations under the License.\n */;\n}\n\nvar to = function(t, e) {\n    this.progress = t, this.zo = e;\n}, eo = /** @class */ function() {\n    function t(t, e, n) {\n        this.wo = t, this.Ho = e, this.Ti = n\n        /**\n     * Get the local view of the document identified by `key`.\n     *\n     * @returns Local view of the document or null if we don't have any cached\n     * state for it.\n     */;\n    }\n    return t.prototype.Jo = function(t, e) {\n        var n = this;\n        return this.Ho.vi(t, e).next((function(r) {\n            return n.Yo(t, e, r);\n        }));\n    }, \n    /** Internal version of `getDocument` that allows reusing batches. */ t.prototype.Yo = function(t, e, n) {\n        return this.wo.fi(t, e).next((function(t) {\n            for (var r = 0, i = n; r < i.length; r++) {\n                t = i[r].xs(e, t);\n            }\n            return t;\n        }));\n    }, \n    // Returns the view of the given `docs` as they would appear after applying\n    // all mutations in the given `batches`.\n    t.prototype.Xo = function(t, e, n) {\n        var r = vn();\n        return e.forEach((function(t, e) {\n            for (var i = 0, o = n; i < o.length; i++) {\n                e = o[i].xs(t, e);\n            }\n            r = r.Ht(t, e);\n        })), r;\n    }, \n    /**\n     * Gets the local view of the documents identified by `keys`.\n     *\n     * If we don't have cached state for a document in `keys`, a NoDocument will\n     * be stored for that key in the resulting set.\n     */\n    t.prototype.Zo = function(t, e) {\n        var n = this;\n        return this.wo.getEntries(t, e).next((function(e) {\n            return n.tc(t, e);\n        }));\n    }, \n    /**\n     * Similar to `getDocuments`, but creates the local view from the given\n     * `baseDocs` without retrieving documents from the local store.\n     */\n    t.prototype.tc = function(t, e) {\n        var n = this;\n        return this.Ho.Si(t, e).next((function(r) {\n            var i = n.Xo(t, e, r), o = dn();\n            return i.forEach((function(t, e) {\n                // TODO(http://b/32275378): Don't conflate missing / deleted.\n                e || (e = new Ut(t, Z.min())), o = o.Ht(t, e);\n            })), o;\n        }));\n    }, \n    /**\n     * Performs a query against the local view of all documents.\n     *\n     * @param transaction - The persistence transaction.\n     * @param query - The query to match documents against.\n     * @param sinceReadTime - If not set to SnapshotVersion.min(), return only\n     *     documents that have been read since this snapshot version (exclusive).\n     */\n    t.prototype.Wr = function(t, e, n) {\n        /**\n * Returns whether the query matches a single document by path (rather than a\n * collection).\n */\n        return function(t) {\n            return it.Et(t.path) && null === t.collectionGroup && 0 === t.filters.length;\n        }(e) ?
