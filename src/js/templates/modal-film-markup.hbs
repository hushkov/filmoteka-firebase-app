            <p class="modal-meta__text">Four of the West’s most infamous outlaws assemble to steal a huge stash of gold
                from the most corrupt settlement of the
                gold rush towns. But not all goes to plan one is killed and the other three escapes with bags of gold
                hide out in the
                abandoned gold mine where they happen across another gang of three – who themselves were planning to hit
                the very same
                bank! As tensions rise, things go from bad to worse as they realise the bags of gold are filled with
                lead... they’ve
                been double crossed – but by who and how?
